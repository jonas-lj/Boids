# Boids

This repo contains an implementation of Craig Raynolds' Boids algorithm in Java. It is built and run from the command line using `mvn install`and `mvn exec:java` respectively.

The code depends on the Ruffini library which is included as a submodule and may be downloaded by executing `git submodule update --init`. It may also be cloned directly from its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jonas-lj/Ruffini).
